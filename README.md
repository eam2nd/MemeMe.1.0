# MemeMe.1.0

The MemeMe 1.0 iOS app demonstrates the use of UI controls (toolbars, buttons, textfields, imageviews/pickers), outlets, actions, delegates and keyboard notifications.

This app allows you to choose an image from your photo library or from the camera and overlays two text fields where you can type up a message for your meme.  Plus, you can share your meme using the activities functionality in iOS.

MemeMe 1.0 is the second project in the iOS Developer Nanodegree in Udacity.
